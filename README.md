All driver binary files form a board support package to be used on Poco X3 Pro devices to provide hardware support for the Windows operating system.

These driver files are not perfect, typos may exist, feel free to file an issue on GitHub in case you found any. These driver files are based on @gus33000 's drivers for Surface Duo. Huge thanks to @gus33000!
